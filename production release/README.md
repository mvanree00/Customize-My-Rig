# Customize My Rig

An automated PC builder that creates a parts list based on the preferences specified by the user. Once the PC is built, the specifications of each component are shown. The price is also displayed, and when clicked, redirects to the site that is selling the product. Each price is updated if it has not been updated within the last 6 hours, which means when first loading the site it may take longer to load due to gathering the current prices of the displayed items (don't want to display inaccurate prices). Users can also use the buttons at the bottom of the build page to spend 10% more or 10% less than their initial budget.
