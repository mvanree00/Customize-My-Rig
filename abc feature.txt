A - Using webscraper to get prices or use an API that does this for us
  - Hold prices in a database
  - Each type of item (CPU, GPU, etc.) will have its own db schema (i.e. GPU - power draw, price, performance ratio)
  - Write an algorithm to match together compatible parts with most performance
B - Update price regularly (preferably at least once an hour)
  - User inputs desired features ( RGB, Gaming vs Workstation vs Streaming, etc.) 
C - User friendly interface / clean layout
  - Add support for upgrading a pc, user enters their current parts and gets suggested upgrade parts
